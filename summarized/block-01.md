### **Point (P)**  
**Build:**  
- Create a "D" shape by carving backward around the center point.  
- Set up square with the IC, maintaining knee-down compression.  

**Execution:**  
- **Key Picture:** Compressed "C" between you and IC; side bodies tight.  
- **Movement:** Backward carve into the first compressed picture → transition to "cat picture" (knee on IC).  
- **Focus:** Keep hip pressure into IC; long visual over left shoulder to maintain alignment.  

**Constraints:**  
- Avoid drifting away from IC; maintain small piece size for control.  
- No levels during rotation to prevent imbalance.  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Solo drill: Carve backward around a fixed point while staying parallel to a tangent line.  
- Delay head switch to avoid hip separation; stay "mellow" during rotation.  

**Pictures/Inters to Reference:**  
- Compressed "C" with IC.  
- "Cat picture" (knee placement on IC).  
- Line through center point (spine alignment).

### **Tail (T)**  
**Build:**  
- Anchor on the line between OC and IC; keep side bodies square.  
- Commit early to movement, trusting OC to wait.  

**Execution:**  
- **Key Picture:** Line through center point (spine aligned with IC and OC).  
- **Movement:** Drive legs forward immediately after compression → anchor to push center point.  
- **Focus:** Avoid backward drift; keep compression with OC.  

**Constraints:**  
- Prevent center point from translating backward.  
- Maintain tight side bodies (no daylight between slots).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Drill: Practice "no-grip" setups to refine line placement.  
- Actively squeeze hip into OC during rotation.  

**Pictures/Inters to Reference:**  
- Line through center point (IC/OC/Tail alignment).  
- "Cat picture" with OC.

### **Outside Center (OC)**  
**Build:**  
- Guide Point into compressed "C" by rotating into line with Tail.  
- Stay square; avoid cheating pre-rotation.  

**Execution:**  
- **Key Picture:** Spine aligned with center point and Tail.  
- **Movement:** Rotate Point into "cat picture" → wait for Tail’s legs to clear before moving.  
- **Focus:** Track Tail’s knees visually; avoid aggressive overstepping.  

**Constraints:**  
- Do NOT lift or create levels during close.  
- Prevent piece from extending (keep small).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Solo drill: Forward carve while staying perpendicular to a tangent line.  
- Use hip pressure (not arms) to guide Point.  

**Pictures/Inters to Reference:**  
- Line through center point (spine alignment).  
- Tail’s knees as visual cue for timing.

### **Inside Center (IC)**  
**Build:**  
- Slide sideways into compression with Point; knee down.  
- Rotate to create "cat picture" with Point.  

**Execution:**  
- **Key Picture:** Compressed "C" with Point → "cat picture" transition.  
- **Movement:** Squeeze hip into Point; long visual over right shoulder.  
- **Focus:** Resist rotation by pressing into Point (avoid hip separation).  

**Constraints:**  
- Maintain side-body compression (no daylight).  
- Avoid over-guiding Point with arms (use body rotation).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Solo drill: Forward carve around a circle with hip pressure inward.  
- Use no-grip drills to refine body-driven movement.  

**Pictures/Inters to Reference:**  
- Compressed "C" with Point.  
- Line through center point (spine alignment).

### **Training Tips for All Positions**  
- **No-Grip Lock Drill:** Refine body control without relying on grips.  
- **Slow-Motion Reps:** Focus on level maintenance and piece compression.  
- **Solo Carving Drills:** Practice forward/backward carves around fixed points.  
- **Debrief On-Level Success:** Count reps where pieces stayed compressed and on-level.
