### **Outside Center (OC)**  
**Build:**  
- Start in a modified "D" formation, slightly more open than traditional. Align parallel to Tail (T).  
- Reference: Target your left knee to land in Tail’s hand (key constraint).  

**Execution:**  
- Initiate a **forward move** to switch slots, pushing your center point toward Inside Center (IC).  
- Coordinate timing with IC to avoid collisions (move simultaneously).  
- Maintain flat levels; avoid sinking or lifting.  

**Constraints:**  
- Ensure your knee lands precisely in Tail’s hand.  
- Keep parallel headings with Tail throughout.  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Focus on compressing into the piece (like Block 6’s mechanics) to shorten travel.  
- Delay head switching until after knee placement to prevent rotation.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Drill forward moves while mirroring Tail’s parallel heading.  
- Practice syncing your start with IC’s side-slide.

### **Inside Center (IC)**  
**Build:**  
- Begin in a slightly open "D" formation, lower than OC.  
- Reference: Place your right knee on a line halfway between OC’s grip and Tail’s hand.  

**Execution:**  
- **Side-slide first**, then rotate. Keep your head low to clear OC’s knee.  
- Maintain a flat body position to avoid pitching up.  

**Constraints:**  
- Avoid body pitch (common pitfall). Head and upper body stay heavy/down.  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Track the pre-identified knee placement spot with peripheral vision.  
- Use minimal rotation to stay compact.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Drill side-slides with a weighted upper body (simulate flat movement).  
- Practice quick knee placement on a marked line.

### **Point (P)**  
**Build:**  
- Form a relaxed "D" with OC, slightly open.  
- Reference: Back up while lifting your knee to match OC’s upward motion.  

**Execution:**  
- Move **backward and upward** to help OC’s grip travel.  
- Maintain levels to avoid going under Tail’s legs.  

**Constraints:**  
- Keep the grip path tight; overtravel forces recovery.  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Align your head with the agreed finish spot (where IC’s waist started).  
- Use backward pressure to compress the piece.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Drill backward knee lifts while maintaining eye contact with OC.  
- Visualize the grip’s path during setup.  

---

### **Tail (T)**  
**Build:**  
- Set up parallel to OC. Prepare to rotate in place.  
- Reference: Assist IC’s leg movement by keeping the piece compact.  

**Execution:**  
- Rotate smoothly to place your right hand where your left was.  
- Maintain backward pressure to stabilize the piece.  

**Constraints:**  
- Move only enough to clear IC’s path (avoid overtravel).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Focus on guiding IC’s leg with your rotation.  
- Keep levels consistent with the back piece to avoid destabilizing.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Practice in-place rotations while maintaining grip pressure.  
- Drill timing with IC’s side-slide.

### **Key Visuals/Interactions to Reference**  
1. **Modified "D" Formation (Build):** Slightly open angles; OC/Tail and P/IC parallel.  
2. **Knee-to-Hand Line (Execution):** OC’s knee targets Tail’s hand; IC’s knee aligns halfway.  
3. **Flat Levels:** Avoid pitching (IC) or sinking (OC).  
4. **Finish Spot:** OC and P meet where IC’s waist started.  

--- 

**Training Focus for All:**  
- Prioritize syncing movements (OC/IC start together).  
- Use pre-identified visual markers for knee/hand placement.  
- Drill flat body mechanics to minimize level changes.
