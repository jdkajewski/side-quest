**Point (P)**  
- **Build**:  
  - Set up square side body with OC and Tail.  
  - Secure a "hard grip" early, ensuring alignment with OC and Tail.  
  - Reference: Square side body picture with OC and Tail.  
- **Execution**:  
  - Key the piece by going **up** (vertical) or stepping **left** (flat) to create a side body.  
  - Stay flat during rotation to avoid pitching; squeeze forward to compress the piece.  
  - Rotate 270° in place, ensuring legs clear OC’s head.  
  - Finish in reverse side body with OC and IC.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Avoid moving backward or colliding with tunnel walls (vertical technique).  
  - Maintain proximity to OC and IC during rotation.  
- **Advanced Tips**:  
  - Prioritize slow, controlled rotations over speed.  
  - Focus on squeezing into the piece (not upward) to stay compact.  
- **Training Tips**:  
  - Practice rotations on level (no vertical movement) to refine spatial awareness.  
  - Drill "squeeze-and-rotate" motions in the tunnel.

**Tail (T)**  
- **Build**:  
  - Allow OC to step forward into the line between P and IC.  
  - Keep arms slightly bent for compression during rotation.  
- **Execution**:  
  - Drive the piece forward while rotating, anchoring knees between OC’s starting position.  
  - Pull OC back with left grip to stabilize the piece before completing rotation.  
  - Maintain low hips to keep legs in the wind for control.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Timing with OC’s initiation; avoid outrunning OC.  
  - Keep the cat flat to prevent uneven levels.  
- **Advanced Tips**:  
  - Use a "mellow" head switch to avoid disrupting rotation.  
  - Focus on compressing the piece during the initial move.  
- **Training Tips**:  
  - Drill two-way coordination with OC to sync rotation timing.  
  - Practice anchoring and pulling OC in solo carves.

**Outside Center (OC)**  
- **Build**:  
  - Step forward into the line between P and IC, in front of Tail.  
  - Maintain a straight cat with Tail.  
- **Execution**:  
  - Side-slide while keeping the center point of the piece between knees.  
  - Look long over the right shoulder; delay head switch until grips are in view.  
  - Finish by stopping the piece between P and IC.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Avoid getting ahead of Tail’s rotation.  
  - Keep upper body square to maintain levels.  
- **Advanced Tips**:  
  - Squeeze backward slightly during the slide to compress the piece.  
  - Prioritize stopping the piece cleanly between P and IC.  
- **Training Tips**:  
  - Solo drills: Practice side-sliding while keeping a fixed center point.  
  - Work with Tail on timing initiation (e.g., "creepers" drills).

**Inside Center (IC)**  
- **Build**:  
  - Wait patiently for P to key the piece.  
  - Ensure Tail’s path is clear before rotating.  
- **Execution**:  
  - Turn **early** (vertical) or **late** (flat) to avoid blocking Tail.  
  - Rotate 225° to create a side body with OC at the close.  
  - Actively squeeze left knee inward to solidify the final grip.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Do not slow down the piece; prioritize clearing Tail’s path.  
  - Avoid over-rotating past the side body at the close.  
- **Advanced Tips**:  
  - Resist the urge to "steal" the key from P.  
  - Focus on building the side body with OC, not just rotating.  
- **Training Tips**:  
  - Drill timed rotations with Tail’s movement (e.g., "knees through" timing).  
  - Practice holding side body positions in static grips.

**Key Visual References**  
- **Point**: Reverse side body with OC during rotation; straight cat spinning on center.  
- **Tail**: Knees anchored between OC’s starting position; compressed piece during rotation.  
- **OC**: Long head check over right shoulder; straight cat with Tail.  
- **IC**: Side body with OC at close; knees cleared from Tail’s path.  

**Vertical vs. Flat Techniques**  
- **Vertical (P)**: Up-and-over rotation with flat body position.  
- **Flat (P)**: Step left into side body, minimal vertical movement.  
- **IC**: Early rotation (vertical) vs. late rotation (flat) to accommodate Tail.
