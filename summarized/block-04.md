### **Outside Center (OC)**  
**Build:**  
- Position your knee on the line between Point (P) and Tail (T). Maintain minimal distance from P to reduce travel later.  
- Reference: Align your spine with the piece’s center; Tail sets up slightly to your right.  

**Execution:**  
- Step out to 90 degrees, **keeping knees on the original line** (critical constraint).  
- Open your upper body ("fade out") while anchoring knees.  
- Look over your right shoulder to track P’s return path.  

**Constraints:**  
- Avoid aggressive rotation or head-switching too early (prevents orbital momentum).  
- Minimize vertical movement to keep the piece flat.  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Delay head switch until you feel IC/Tail guiding your knees back into the "hole" (space where IC started).  
- Push knees forward into the hole for a straight-line return to P.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Drill stepping out *without lifting knees off the line*. Focus on upper-body fade.  
- Practice late head switches to prioritize translation over rotation.

### **Inside Center (IC)**  
**Build:**  
- Position perpendicular to OC, placing your knee near OC’s ear/shoulder.  
- Reference: Form a "compressed" donut shape with P and OC.  

**Execution:**  
- Drive forward with your right knee to lock into the compressed position.  
- Maintain forward rotation to keep grips in front of you.  

**Constraints:**  
- Stay level with OC; avoid lifting hips (prevents destabilizing the piece).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Use peripheral vision to track OC’s knees and guide them into the return hole.  
- Stay arched to resist upward momentum from leg power.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Work on quick knee placement drills (simulate hitting OC’s ear/shoulder).  
- Practice maintaining forward rotation while compressed.

### **Point (P)**  
**Build:**  
- Form a "donut" with IC, placing your head between IC and T.  
- Reference: Align your knee in front of OC’s nose during setup.  

**Execution:**  
- Rotate ~100 degrees to slot your head into the gap between IC and T.  
- Avoid going under T’s legs; prioritize staying level.  

**Constraints:**  
- Never exceed 90 degrees of separation from OC (prevents over-rotation).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Aim to finish at the spot where IC’s waist started.  
- Shorten your path if uncertain—it’s easier to adjust than recover from overshooting.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Visualize the halfway "donut" picture to gauge head placement.  
- Drill stopping rotation at 90 degrees to build spatial awareness.

### **Tail (T)**  
**Build:**  
- Set up directly behind OC, slightly shifted right.  
- Reference: Keep straight-line pressure on the piece to minimize its size.  

**Execution:**  
- Move in a straight line across OC’s path to clear space.  
- Guide OC’s knees into the return hole once you’ve passed through.  

**Constraints:**  
- Move only as far as needed to create space (avoid overtravel).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Maintain backward pressure on the piece to keep it compact.  
- Focus on OC’s knees—your movement dictates their return path.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Practice minimal lateral movement drills ("how little can I go?").  
- Work on timing your exit to sync with OC’s step-out.

### **Key Visuals/Interactions to Reference**  
1. **Donut Formation (Build):** OC’s knee aligned with P’s nose; IC perpendicular.  
2. **Compressed Picture (Execution):** OC’s knees on line, IC’s knee near OC’s ear.  
3. **Return Hole (Advanced):** Space where IC started; guide OC’s knees here.  
4. **90-Degree Finish:** OC and P meet at IC’s initial waist position.
