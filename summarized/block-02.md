### **Outside Center (OC)**  
- **Build:**  
  - Step forward onto the line connecting Point to Tail, placing your center point directly in front of Point.  
  - Ensure your grip aligns with IC’s eye level to maintain proper levels.  
  - **Key Picture/Inter:** Line from Point’s spine through OC’s position to the Tail/IC junction.  

- **Execution:**  
  - On Point’s key, pivot the donut by pushing with your right knee (imagine a “push pin” at your grip) to shift the donut left.  
  - Focus on a slight backward carve and rotation to meet Point efficiently.  
  - **Constraint:** Maintain proximity to Point; avoid drifting too far forward.  

- **Advanced Tips:**  
  - Arrive in the build already anticipating backward motion (start moving as the donut is keyed).  
  - Keep your head level and grip high to avoid pitching forward.  

- **Training Tips:**  
  - Practice solo drills with knees together and inside knee down for smooth backward carves.  
  - Drill donut rotations without grips to refine body control.

### **Inside Center (IC)**  
- **Build:**  
  - Step forward into the line, ensuring your knee is at OC’s eye level.  
  - **Key Picture/Inter:** The line through Point’s spine and OC’s position; ensure your grip aligns with OC’s head.  

- **Execution:**  
  - Initiate rotation by pivoting your lower body onto the line while keeping the donut flat.  
  - Watch Point through the donut over your right shoulder to guide OC back.  
  - **Constraint:** Avoid over-rotating; focus on 33% input to maintain donut shape.  

- **Advanced Tips:**  
  - Keep your head close to the grip to stabilize the donut.  
  - Use minimal, synchronized effort with OC and Tail to spin the piece.  

- **Training Tips:**  
  - Practice “flat and level” drills in the tunnel, emphasizing even weight distribution.  
  - Use a visual marker (e.g., tunnel net center) to refine rotation consistency.

### **Point (P)**  
- **Build:**  
  - Verify the donut is fully built (grips in place) before keying the shift.  
  - **Key Picture/Inter:** Donut shifted left, creating a clear path for your forward movement.  

- **Execution:**  
  - Move slightly left initially, then drive straight forward once the donut clears.  
  - Snag the inside leg of the target and finish rotation.  
  - **Constraint:** Avoid rotating too early; prioritize adjustability over speed.  

- **Advanced Tips:**  
  - Commit late to adapt to imperfect donut shifts.  
  - Keep your trajectory straight after the initial sidestep.  

- **Training Tips:**  
  - Drill “late rotation” scenarios to build muscle memory for adjustments.  
  - Focus on head-switching smoothly while tracking the donut.

### **Tail (T)**  
- **Build:**  
  - Step forward to place your knee on the line connecting Point to OC/IC.  
  - **Key Picture/Inter:** Line through OC’s and IC’s positions; align your knee with this axis.  

- **Execution:**  
  - Keep your lower body fixed (imagine a “push pin” at your knee) while guiding OC’s lag with upper-body rotation.  
  - Watch IC’s movement to time your input for donut spinning.  
  - **Constraint:** Avoid lifting your knee off the line during rotation.  

- **Advanced Tips:**  
  - Use peripheral vision to track Point through the donut.  
  - Stay mellow during head-switches to maintain stability.  

- **Training Tips:**  
  - Practice “stationary knee” drills in the tunnel to reinforce lower-body stability.  
  - Work on synchronized rotation with IC using verbal or visual cues.

### **Shared Constraints & Visuals**  
- **Donut Integrity:** All positions must maintain the donut shape (flat, level, grips aligned).  
- **Key Line:** The spine line from Point through OC to Tail/IC must stay visible during rotations.  
- **Levels:** Keep grips at the eye level of the teammate behind you to avoid arching or sinking.
