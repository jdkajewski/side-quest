### **Outside Center (OC)**  
**Build:**  
- Step slightly East to draw Inside Center (IC) into the formation.  
- Create a tight grip with IC, keeping the knee close to IC’s hip.  
- Maintain a **45-degree angle** relative to IC; visualize an **“aquarium glass”** to avoid Point’s knees during rotation.  

**Execution:**  
- **Key Picture:** A **three-way half-star** with IC and Point at the 90-degree turn.  
- Slide flat (no body dip) to avoid pitching IC forward.  
- Stop upper body at Point’s starting hand position for the catch.  

**Constraints:**  
- Avoid lowering below the formation if using vertical levels.  
- Ensure grip remains at IC’s eye level (no reaching down).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Focus on **“rubbing your nose along the aquarium glass”** to stay close but avoid Point’s knees.  
- Keep the piece flat for stability; avoid over-pitching.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Practice on creepers to refine the slide and rotation.  
- Drill the **“half-star”** picture with IC and Point.

### **Inside Center (IC)**  
**Build:**  
- Step forward into the center, aligning the previous formation’s midpoint **between your shoulder blades**.  
- Keep the grip with OC at **eye level** (no reaching down).  

**Execution:**  
- Perform a **backward carve** (knees together, inside knee down) to rotate into the “donut” picture with Point.  
- Assist in moving the junction (OC’s knee) to clear space for Tail.  

**Key Picture:** A **donut-shaped formation** with Point at the close.  

**Constraints:**  
- Avoid leaning forward; stay compact to minimize Tail’s reach.  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Focus on **straight-line entry** into the build.  
- Watch Point during the carve to maintain proximity.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Practice backward carving in the tunnel.  
- Work on grip timing with OC to avoid delays.

### **Point (P)**  
**Build:**  
- Confirm Tail is ready by **looking across the formation**.  
- Align spine parallel to the center point (between shoulder blades).  

**Execution:**  
- **Key Picture:** A **half-star** with IC and OC at the 90-degree turn.  
- Perform a **360-degree turn in place** after confirming the half-star.  
- Ensure your knee finishes in OC’s hand during the close.  

**Constraints:**  
- Timing is critical; initiate the turn only after confirming Tail’s readiness.  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Use a **mellow head switch** during the turn to maintain balance.  
- Keep spine straight and avoid over-rotating.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Drill the **half-star picture** with IC and OC.  
- Practice stopping momentum cleanly for the 360 turn.

### **Tail (T)**  
**Build:**  
- Compress tightly into the formation, staying close to Point.  
- Prioritize gripping OC’s knee first (or simultaneously with IC).  

**Execution:**  
- Assist centers in moving laterally to clear a **straight-line path for your knee**.  
- Avoid hip rotation; drive knee directly toward the target grip.  

**Key Picture:** A **compressed build** with minimal gap between you and Point.  

**Constraints:**  
- Short arms? Focus on ultra-tight compression (chicken-wing IC’s grip).  

**Advanced Tips:**  
- Use OC/IC grips to “pull” centers out of your way.  
- Keep head up and close to reduce grip distance.  

**Training Tips:**  
- Practice on creepers to refine the straight-line knee drive.  
- Work with OC/IC to minimize hip drift during the move.

### **Visual References**  
- **Half-star:** Point, IC, and OC form a 3-way star at 90 degrees.  
- **Aquarium glass:** OC visualizes a plane to avoid Point’s knees.  
- **Donut:** IC and Point form a circular shape at the close.  

### **General Training Tips**  
- Use creepers to simulate air movement for builds.  
- Focus on backward carving for IC and Point roles.  
- Prioritize flat formations to reduce drag and improve stability.
